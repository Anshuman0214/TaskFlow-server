1. Introduction
The database is the foundation of TaskFlow. It is designed to support a production-grade multi-tenant SaaS application with a strong emphasis on scalability, maintainability, security, and performance.
Rather than treating MongoDB as a simple document store, this design follows structured engineering practices commonly used in enterprise applications. Every collection, relationship, and indexing strategy is planned to support future growth without requiring major schema redesigns.
The primary goals of the database design are:
•	Ensure complete tenant isolation.
•	Maintain data consistency.
•	Support efficient querying.
•	Enable auditing and traceability.
•	Simplify future feature development.
•	Minimize schema changes as the application evolves.
________________________________________
2. Database Design Principles
The following principles apply to every collection and database operation throughout TaskFlow.
________________________________________
2.1 Multi-Tenant First
TaskFlow is a multi-tenant application.
Organizations share the same database but never share data.
Every business entity belongs to an organization either:
•	Directly
•	Indirectly through its parent entity
Example
Organization
    │
Workspace
    │
Project
    │
Task
    │
Comment
Every database query must execute within an organization context.
Cross-organization access is never permitted.
________________________________________
2.2 Consistency Over Convenience
The database favors consistent modeling over short-term convenience.
Relationships will be modeled explicitly rather than duplicating large amounts of data.
Example
Instead of embedding all tasks inside a project document:
{
  "tasks": [...]
}
Tasks are stored in their own collection and referenced by projectId.
Benefits:
•	Better scalability
•	Smaller document size
•	Easier pagination
•	Cleaner indexing
•	Independent lifecycle management
________________________________________
2.3 Predictable Data Structures
Collections should follow a consistent structure.
Developers should immediately recognize:
•	ownership
•	timestamps
•	status
•	soft deletion
•	audit information
Consistency reduces bugs and simplifies maintenance.
________________________________________
2.4 Separation of Concerns
Collections represent independent business entities.
For example:
•	Users
•	Organizations
•	Projects
•	Tasks
•	Comments
Each collection owns only the data that belongs to it.
Business logic belongs in the application layer, not in the database schema.
________________________________________
2.5 Normalization with Practical Denormalization
MongoDB is a document database, but excessive embedding can make updates and queries difficult.
TaskFlow follows these guidelines:
Normalize:
•	Users
•	Organizations
•	Tasks
•	Projects
•	Memberships
•	Sessions
Embed only when:
•	Data is small
•	Data is tightly coupled
•	Data rarely changes
•	Reads significantly outnumber writes
This balances performance with maintainability.
________________________________________
2.6 Security by Design
Security is part of the database design rather than an afterthought.
Sensitive information is never stored in plain text.
Examples:
•	Passwords are hashed.
•	Tokens are hashed where appropriate.
•	Secrets are stored in environment variables.
•	Internal identifiers are never exposed unnecessarily.
________________________________________
2.7 Auditability
Every important action should be traceable.
The system should always be able to answer questions such as:
•	Who created this task?
•	Who updated this project?
•	When was this workspace archived?
•	Who deleted this comment?
Auditability is mandatory for production SaaS applications.
________________________________________
2.8 Scalability
Collections must support:
•	Millions of tasks
•	Thousands of organizations
•	Large workspaces
•	High request volumes
Design decisions should avoid future bottlenecks.
________________________________________
2.9 Performance
Database queries should:
•	Use indexes effectively.
•	Avoid unnecessary joins.
•	Minimize full collection scans.
•	Support pagination.
•	Return only required fields.
Performance should be considered during schema design, not after deployment.
________________________________________
2.10 Maintainability
The schema should be:
•	Easy to understand
•	Easy to extend
•	Backward compatible where possible
•	Consistent across collections
Future developers should understand the database without extensive documentation.
________________________________________
3. Base Entity Pattern
Purpose
Most collections in TaskFlow require the same set of metadata:
•	Creation information
•	Update information
•	Ownership
•	Soft deletion state
•	Audit details
Rather than redefining these fields in every schema, TaskFlow adopts a Base Entity Pattern.
This is not object-oriented inheritance.
Instead, it is a design contract that every business collection follows.
Every business entity must expose the same metadata structure, regardless of its domain.
This provides:
•	Consistent CRUD operations
•	Standard audit information
•	Reusable repository methods
•	Generic service implementations
•	Uniform API responses
•	Easier debugging
•	Easier testing
________________________________________
Standard Base Entity Fields
Every business entity should include the following metadata fields.
Field	Type	Description
_id	ObjectId	Unique identifier
createdAt	Date	Creation timestamp
updatedAt	Date	Last modification timestamp
createdBy	ObjectId	User who created the record
updatedBy	ObjectId	User who last updated the record
isDeleted	Boolean	Soft delete flag
deletedAt	Date | null	Soft deletion timestamp
deletedBy	ObjectId | null	User who performed the deletion
________________________________________
Tenant-Aware Entities
Most business entities are scoped to an organization.
These entities should also include:
Field	Type	Description
organizationId	ObjectId	Owning organization
Examples include:
•	Workspaces
•	Projects
•	Tasks
•	Labels
•	Invitations
•	Notifications
•	Audit Logs
Some entities, such as User, are global and therefore do not include organizationId.
________________________________________
Benefits of the Base Entity Pattern
Consistency
Every collection behaves the same way.
________________________________________
Auditability
Every record records who created, modified, or deleted it.
________________________________________
Soft Delete Support
Deleted records remain recoverable until permanently removed by system policies.
________________________________________
Generic Repository Methods
Repository implementations can share common CRUD behavior because all entities expose the same lifecycle metadata.
________________________________________
Easier API Design
Clients can rely on consistent metadata being returned for every business resource.
________________________________________
Simpler Maintenance
Adding a new collection does not require inventing new audit conventions; it simply adopts the existing contract.
________________________________________
Exceptions
Not every collection should implement the full Base Entity contract.
Examples include:
•	Session
•	Refresh Token
•	Verification Token
•	Password Reset Token
These are short-lived system entities with a limited lifecycle and should contain only the metadata required for their specific purpose.
________________________________________
Design Guideline
Before introducing a new collection, ask:
"Does this represent a business entity with a lifecycle?"
If the answer is yes, the collection should implement the Base Entity Pattern.
If the answer is no, it should remain a lightweight system collection with only the fields necessary for its operation.

12. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
TaskFlow follows a hierarchical multi-tenant architecture where every business resource belongs to an organization either directly or indirectly.
The following diagram represents the logical relationship between all primary entities.
                                   USER
                                     │
                ┌────────────────────┴────────────────────┐
                │                                         │

Collection Categories
TaskFlow separates collections into three categories.
1. Core Business Collections
These collections represent the primary business domain.
•	Users
•	Organizations
•	OrganizationMembers
•	Workspaces
•	Projects
•	Tasks
________________________________________
2. Collaboration Collections
These collections support collaboration.
•	TaskComments
•	TaskAttachments
•	TaskActivities
•	Labels
•	Notifications
•	Invitations
________________________________________
3. System Collections
Infrastructure collections.

Stores global user accounts.
A user exists independently of any organization and may belong to multiple organizations simultaneously.
Examples:
•	John may belong to Company A.
•	John may also belong to Company B.
The User collection contains only identity information.
Authorization is handled through OrganizationMember.

Tenant Ownership
The following collections are tenant-aware and must include an organizationId reference.
•	OrganizationMembers
•	Workspaces
•	Projects
•	Tasks
•	TaskComments
•	TaskAttachments
•	TaskActivities
•	Labels
•	Invitations
•	Notifications
•	AuditLogs
The following collections are global and must not include an organizationId.
•	Users
•	Sessions
________________________________________
Design Decisions
Multi-Tenant Isolation
Every business query must execute within an organization context.
Cross-organization access is prohibited.
________________________________________
Membership-Based Authorization
Roles are stored in OrganizationMembers, not in Users.
This allows a single user to have different roles across different organizations.
________________________________________
Self-Referencing Tasks
Subtasks are implemented using a parentTaskId reference rather than a separate SubTask collection.
This keeps the schema simple while supporting unlimited task hierarchies.
________________________________________
Normalized Relationships
Core business entities are stored in separate collections and connected through references.
Embedding is reserved only for small, tightly coupled, and rarely changing data.

Project Collections
________________________________________
1. Projects Collection
Purpose
The Projects collection represents a logical container of work within a workspace.
Projects group related tasks together and provide visibility into progress, ownership, and collaboration.
Examples:
Engineering Workspace
•	Authentication Service

Marketing Workspace
•	Product Launch
•	Social Media Campaign
•	SEO Improvements
________________________________________
Responsibilities

Query Optimization Strategy
The database follows these optimization principles:
•	Always filter by organizationId first for tenant-scoped entities.
•	Use compound indexes matching common filter patterns.
•	Implement cursor-based pagination for large datasets where appropriate.
•	Return only required fields using projections.
•	Avoid N+1 query patterns by batching lookups.
•	Cache expensive analytics queries in Redis.
•	Use aggregation pipelines only for reporting and dashboards.
•	Archive rather than hard-delete business records.
________________________________________
Data Integrity & Cascade Rules
General Principles
TaskFlow uses soft deletion for business entities and explicit cascade handling in the service layer.
MongoDB does not enforce foreign keys, so the application is responsible for maintaining referential integrity.
________________________________________
Cascade Rules
Organization
Deleting an organization:
•	Soft deletes workspaces.
•	Soft deletes projects.
•	Soft deletes tasks.
•	Revokes active sessions for members of that organization.
•	Archives notifications.
•	Preserves audit logs.
________________________________________
Workspace
Deleting a workspace:
•	Soft deletes projects.
•	Soft deletes tasks.
•	Preserves audit history.
________________________________________
Project
Deleting a project:
•	Soft deletes tasks.
•	Preserves comments and attachments until task retention policies apply.
________________________________________
Task
Deleting a task:
•	Soft deletes subtasks.
•	Soft deletes comments.
•	Soft deletes attachments.
•	Preserves task activities.
•	Records an audit log.
________________________________________
User
Deleting a user account:
•	Revokes all sessions.
•	Removes organization memberships.
•	Reassigns ownership where required.
•	Preserves historical references (createdBy, updatedBy) to maintain audit integrity.
________________________________________
Referential Integrity Rules
•	Every Project must reference an existing Workspace.
•	Every Workspace must reference an existing Organization.
•	Every Task must reference an existing Project.
•	Every Comment must reference an existing Task.
•	Every Attachment must reference an existing Task.
•	Every Notification must reference an existing User.
•	Every OrganizationMember must reference both a valid User and Organization.
Validation is enforced at the application layer before persistence.
________________________________________
Common Query Patterns
The following queries represent the most common access patterns anticipated in TaskFlow.
Authentication
•	Find user by email.
•	Validate session by refresh token.
•	Retrieve active sessions for a user.
________________________________________
Organization
•	List organizations for a user.
•	List members of an organization.
•	Retrieve organization settings.
________________________________________
Workspace
•	List workspaces in an organization.
•	Retrieve workspace details.
•	Search workspaces by name.
________________________________________
Project
•	List projects in a workspace.
•	Retrieve project statistics.
•	Search active projects.

Database Design Summary
The database design follows a normalized, multi-tenant architecture optimized for scalability, maintainability, and security.
Key characteristics include:
•	Strict tenant isolation using organizationId.
•	Base Entity pattern for consistent metadata.
•	Membership-based authorization model.
•	Soft deletion with audit preservation.
•	Normalized business entities connected through references.
•	Redis-backed session management and caching.
•	Service-layer enforcement of referential integrity.
•	Query-first indexing strategy aligned with application access patterns.
This design provides a stable foundation for implementing repositories, services, and APIs while remaining extensible for future features such as recurring tasks, AI assistance, billing, and real-time collaboration.
